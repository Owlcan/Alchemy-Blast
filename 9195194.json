To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\r\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\r\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.
